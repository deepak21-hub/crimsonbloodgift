Its petals gleamed like midnight silk, but the veins shimmered crimson—as though the flower itself had a heartbeat.\n\nAttached was a note:\n\n\"When the Blood Moon calls, the heart it chooses must answer.\"\n— C.\n\nA cold breeze swept across your room—and when you turned…\n\nHe stood there.\n\nTall, pale, impossibly beautiful. Dark hair brushing his shoulders. Eyes glowing a deep, haunting red.\n\nNot monstrous. Tragic. Lonely.\n\n\"You finally see me,\" he whispered.",
